# compiler
Compiler made in PHP, JS and MySQL for compilers course taught at URBE. This program is capable of making basic lexic, syntactic and semantic in self made programming language.

-You can find examples in the file CodeExamples.txt. 
-The file conexion.php has the all the variables for connecting to the database. 
-The front end is not responsive
-The database file is named compilador.sql

This project was my first approach to Web Development so it has a little mix between Jquery, JS, PHP without a specific programming pattern.
